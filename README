Grbl-Jogger - A simple interface to send jogging commands to a CNC controller running GRBL.  Written in python using wxPython.  It depends on wxPython and pySerial, two awesome and free modules.  

The units of measurement is imperial although it will probably be selectable in future versions.  The default feedrate is 12IPM but is easily changed in the script.

Initial Release.  Very rough around the edges.  The GUI needs a bit of cleaning.  Overall it is functional though.
